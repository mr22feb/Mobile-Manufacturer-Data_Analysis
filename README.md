# SQL Case Study - Advanced

## Business Scenario

The database "Cellphones Information" contains details on cell phone sales or transactions. It includes dimensions like Dim_manufacturer, Dim_model, Dim_customer, Dim_Location, and the Fact_Transactions table storing information about specific cellphone sales.

## Data Availability

Assume that you do not have direct access to the data. You need to create a schema based on the provided representation to work on the case study.

## Approach

The approach for this case study involves:

1. **Understanding the Database Structure**: Analyze the provided database schema to understand the relationships between different tables and the data they store.

2. **Defining Queries**: Define SQL queries based on the questions provided in the case study. Consider optimal query performance and accuracy.

3. **Data Exploration**: Explore the data to identify patterns, anomalies, and insights that can be leveraged to answer the questions effectively.

## Methodology

The methodology followed in this case study includes:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the database schema based on the provided representation. Ensure that data is structured correctly and relevant for analysis.

2. **Query Execution**: Execute SQL queries to extract the required information from the database. Validate query results to ensure accuracy.

3. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Analyze query results to derive meaningful insights and answers to the questions posed in the case study. Interpret the data to draw conclusions.

## Case Study Rules

1. Answers should be filled in the provided answer_template file between the BEGIN and END marks.
2. Do not remove the BEGIN and END marks. Place the query for each question between them.
3. Create the database from the given creation file. Making permanent changes to the original database is prohibited.
4. Ensure the output query for each question returns only one table.
5. Rename the answer_template.sql file with your email ID before final submission.
6. Zip the final file for upload as the LMS does not accept .SQL extension files.
7. Additional spacing is permitted between BEGIN and END but do not modify the marks.
8. Avoid plagiarism or sharing answers with peers to maintain integrity.

## Questions

1. List all states with customers who bought cellphones from 2005 till today.
2. Identify the state in the US buying the most 'Samsung' cell phones.
3. Show the number of transactions for each model per zip code per state.
4. Display the cheapest cellphone including its price.
5. Find the average price for each model among the top 5 manufacturers in sales quantity, ordered by average price.
6. List customer names and average amount spent in 2009 where the average exceeds 500.
7. Determine if any model was in the top 5 in terms of quantity in 2008, 2009, and 2010 simultaneously.
8. Show the manufacturer with the second highest sales in 2009 and 2010.
9. Display manufacturers selling cellphones in 2010 but not in 2009.
10. Find the top 100 customers with their average spend and quantity per year, along with the percentage change in spend.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Set up the database schema using the provided creation file.
3. Fill in your answers in the answer_template.sql file as per the rules.
4. Rename the answer_template.sql file with your email ID.
